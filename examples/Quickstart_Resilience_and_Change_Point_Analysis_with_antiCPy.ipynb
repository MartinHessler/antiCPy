    "# Quickstart: Resilience and Change Point Analysis with *antiCPy*\n",
    "\n",
    "Resilience analysis covers a variety of concepts and methods. This contribution aims to provide you with a basic introduction in how [*antiCPy*'s Langevin-based stability analysis](#resilienceanalysis) tools work. Additionally, we briefly consider how [*antiCPy*'s Bayesian change point fit](#CP) implementation and how it may be used to roughly infer time horizons of future destabilization and critical transitions. Finally, we summarize our [key takeaways](#summary). The classification of bifurcation types and stability analysis using delay embedding and eigenvalue estimation is treated in this [hands-on tutorial](https://anticpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/early_warnings/dominant_eigenvalue/dominant_eigenvalue_tutorial.html) and the corresponding [math guide](https://anticpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/early_warnings/dominant_eigenvalue/dominant_eigenvalue_maths.html).\n",

    "We print the shape of the dataset and recognize that it contains $4{\\cdot}10^4$ observations, before we visualize the data. In the first interval, the data fluctuate around a fixed average. This means the system is in a *stable state*, where conditions do not change over time. Around time $t\\approx 750$ (orange dashed line), the system conditions begin to change slowly. For example, this could be the food availability in an ecological system, or the sea surface temperature in a climate system. Because the change is gradual, the system adjusts and tracks the new equilibrium. However, approximately at time $t\\approx1429$ (red dashed line), the system abruptly jumps to another regime. This phenomenon is called a *critical transition*, in which the formerly stable state disappears, leaving only another stable state near $x\\approx -1.5$. For a detailed mathematical discussion of the model, please refer to the [Excursion](#excursion).\n",

    "Now, we can use *antiCPy* to quantify the stability of the system over time. Briefly, the data is modelled by deterministic slow-scale and stochastic fast-scale dynamics. The algorithm estimates the model's so-called *drift slope* $\\zeta$ as a local measure of stability: negative and positive drift slopes indicate stable and unstable states, respectively. Its modulus determines the decay/growth rate (minus/plus sign) of fluctuations. By using *antiCPy*, we evaluate small data windows containing `window_size` data points to track stability over time. After computing a window, it is shifted by `window_shift`. Before analysing the data, we adjust it to make each time window roughly stationary. This allows us to focus on the local fluctuations without being biased by slow changes in the trend. In the code block below, we use *antiCPy*'s built-in Gaussian kernel detrending to subtract a smoothed slow trend from the raw data. Finally, we use a computationally lightweight maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation to determine the drift slopes and noise levels over time. By default, half of the available CPU cores are occupied. You can change this by either using `'all'` or an integer number of cores. For a serial computation replace `fast_MAP_resilience_scan` by `perform_MAP_resilience_scan`.\n",

    "First, we visualize the detrending for a sanity check by using `plot_detrending=True`. Here, we apply a trade-off between the smoothness and the correctness of the filtered slow trend in the transition area. If the kernel width (`Gaussian_kernel_sigma`) is chosen too large, the slow trend estimates smear out over the transition interval. Subtracting such an estimate would lead to biased estimates in this particular time interval. Next, *antiCPy* hints to credible intervals from 5-95% and 1-99%, as these percentiles are fixed, but can be arbitrarily chosen for other estimators. Once, we get the output that parallel processing has finished, we can define the custom plot function (first code block below) to visualize our results and compare the drift slopes and noise levels to the ground truths (second code block below)."

    "As we want to convince ourselves from the precision of the estimates, we align each of them to the mid point of the corresponding data window. Credible intervals (CIs) are shown in orange. Note that a time interval of one window length remains without any estimates due to the rolling windows of finite size (here one half at the beginning and one half at the end of the entire time range). In this simple example, the MAP estimation provides smooth and precise stability estimates, but deviates from the ground truth in direct vicinity of the transition. The reason is again given by the finite window size. This relationship is illustrated by the grey-shaded rolling window that is centered around the critical transition at time $t=1429$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Large rolling windows limit the time resolution of the drift slope trend around the critical transition, as visible in the grey-shaded window. The theoretical zero-crossing is suppressed, as windows overlapping the transition data incorporate pre-, intra-, and post-transition data. This data mixture violates the stationarity assumption and leads to biased estimates. Therefore, in the next code block, we significantly reduce the window size and compare new to previous results."

    "On the one hand, the time resolution of the drift slope is significantly improved in the transition area. Furthermore, the theoretically expected zero-crossing can be observed when the transition takes place. On the other hand, smaller time windows cause less precise estimates, as for example $\\hat{\\zeta}\\approx -10$ around time $t=375$. In the worst case, the windows are too small to obtain reliable results. In such cases, *antiCPy*'s most reliable and flexible estimation procedure relies on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, implemented in the [*emcee*](https://emcee.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) package. See also the article [emcee: The MCMC Hammer](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1202.3665) (Foreman-Mackey, Hogg, Lang, Goodman, arXiv (2013)). Furthermore, by using the MCMC procedure we can derive CIs directly from the posterior distributions, without additional assumptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, since this MCMC sampling per window is computationally expensive (roughly 40 min on 20 CPU cores for 198 windows), a detailed evaluation is not suitable for this presentation. Instead, we limit ourselves to a total number of 20 windows and use Markov chains that are too short to reliably determine their correlation lengths. In real applications, all data whithin one correlation length must be neglected to obtain fully independent samples and thus unbiased statistics. Here, we ignore this issue, as the results already underline the robustness of the MCMC procedure for small rolling windows, even if the Markov chains are not fully converged. Moreover, we apply a linear detrending per window, instead of Gaussian kernel detrending over the entire dataset. The code below takes approximately 2.7 min on 5 CPU cores. Note that the missing values at the end are caused by the large window shift."

In our example, the procedure is advantageous, since it enables consistently extrapolating the fit and its CIs, here defined as $3\\sigma$ intervals.

    "In this tutorial, we only could address an exerpt of *antiCPy*'s toolbox. In particular, we discussed two prominent functionalities in more detail: first, the resilience analysis; and second, the Bayesian trend CP fit. In the following, we list key takeaways, refer to advanced functionalities, and conclude with some remarks. \n",
    "\n",
    ">💡 \n",
    "> For standalone Python scripts, please remember to define the entry point using `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` under the package imports if you rely on *antiCPy*'s parallelized algorithms instead of using the serial counterparts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Resilience Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the **key takeaways**:\n",
    "\n",
    "> 1. The drift slope as restoring rate towards a stable state can be estimated using *antiCPy*.\n",
    "> 2. Detrending of the raw data can be crucial to obtain unbiased estimates of local window dynamics.\n",
    "> 3. The window size is an important parameter. Small window estimates react fast to changing dynamics and improve the time resolution, which can be crucial within the transition interval. Larger windows lead to smooth trends and more stable estimates.\n",
    "> 4. The MCMC estimation procedure outperforms the MAP estimation in terms of robustness and flexibility, but is significantly more time consuming. If computation times are a limiting factor, also consider the [binned MAP estimation procedure](https://anticpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/early_warnings/drift_slope/drift_slope.html#antiCPy.early_warnings.drift_slope.binning_langevin_estimation.BinningLangevinEstimation).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we turn towards the Bayesian trend CP fit, the follwing list summarizes **related key functionalities and further reading**:\n",
    "\n",
    "> 1. The `LangevinEstimation` object of *antiCPy* is complemented by the `NonMarkovEstimation` object. Whereas the `LangevinEstimation` model is one-dimensional and incorporates uncorrelated noise, the two-dimensional `NonMarkovEstimation` model accounts for correlated fast-scale dynamics, such as red noise, or slow hidden processes. This may be useful, e.g., in climate dynamics.\n",
    "> 2. Even if the example data were simulated by a one-dimensional model, *antiCPy*'s resilience analysis can be successfully applied to high dimensional models, such as the three-dimensional ecological model considered in [Quantifying resilience and the risk of regime shifts under strong correlated noise](https://doi.org/10.1093/pnasnexus/pgac296) (Heßler & Kamps, PNAS Nexus (2023)). The choice of the system observable is crucial in this context.\n",
    "> 3. The Bayesian resilience analysis is complemented by a dynamic empirical modelling approach that measures stability and classifies destabilization types (i.e., bifurcations; cf. [Excursion](#excursion)). See this [hands-on tutorial](https://anticpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/early_warnings/dominant_eigenvalue/dominant_eigenvalue_tutorial.html) and the [math guide](https://anticpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/early_warnings/dominant_eigenvalue/dominant_eigenvalue_maths.html) for more details.\n",
    "> 4. See also the animation feature to create explanatory movies of *antiCPy*'s resilience analysis algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Trend-Change Point Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the **key takeaways**:\n",
    "\n",
    "> 1. The Bayesian trend CP fit, implemented in *antiCPy*, is a general approach for arbitrary (x,y)-coordinate pairs that may exhibit distinct intervals of linear trends.\n",
    "> 2. The Bayesian fit incorporates all possible CP configurations, yields consistent CIs and marginalized CP PDFs, and can be extrapolated. \n",
    "> 3. It may be used to roughly extrapolate potential transition intervals based on the currently available drift slope estimates. Such extrapolations may be flexibly adapted if the data stream is updated.\n",
    "> 4. For reliable results, small and non-overlapping windows should be used. This guarantees independent samples for the fit and fast reaction to changing dynamics.\n"
