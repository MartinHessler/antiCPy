antiCPy
=======

The antiCPy package provides an easy applicable toolbox to estimate the drift slope

of a Langevin
equation as an early warning signal and extrapolate an early warning signal trend to find the probable transition
horizon based on the current data information. The package aims to provide simple applicable methods and guarantee high
flexibility and also access to the derived interim results.
