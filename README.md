antiCPy
=======

The package abbreviation **antiCPy** stands for ''**anti**cipate **C**ritical **P**oints (and if you like **C**hange **P**oints) 
with **Py**thon''. The vision of the **antiCPy** package is designing a package collection of state-of-the-art
early warning measures, leading indicators and time series analysis tools that focus on system stability and
resilience in general as well as algorithms that might be helpful to estimate time horizons of future transitions or resilience changes.
It provides an easy applicable and efficient toolbox

1. to estimate the drift slope <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\hat{\zeta}"> of a polynomial Langevin equation as an early warning signal via Markov Chain Monte Carlo
   (MCMC) sampling or maximum posterior (MAP) estimation,
2. to estimate a non-Markovian two-time scale polynomial system via MCMC or MAP with the option of a priori activated time scale separation,
3. to estimate the dominant eigenvalue by empiric dynamic modelling approaches like delay embedding and shadow manifolds combined with
   iterated map's linear stability formalism,
4. extrapolate an early warning signal trend to find the probable transition horizon based on the current data information.

Computationally expensive algorithms are implemented both, serially and strongly parallelized to minimize computation times. In case of
the change point trend extrapolation it involves furthermore algorithms that allow for computing of complicated fits with high numbers
of change points without memory errors.
The package aims to provide easily applicable methods and guarantee high flexibility and access to the derived interim results
for research purposes.
